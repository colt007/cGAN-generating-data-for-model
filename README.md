PROJECT-TITLE:
ENHANCING CROP & WEED IDENTIFICATION WITH
SYNTHETIC IMAGE AUGMENTATION

The main objective of this project is likely to improve the accuracy and robustness of crop/weed classification models used in 
precision agriculture.
To reduce the effort needed to prepare these datasets by generating artificial images using cGAN.

The idea this project follows is based on the paper we found on algorithms website:
https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/15/11/401
This project is just our version of implementing this paper.
